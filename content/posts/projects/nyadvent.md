As the New Year of 2022 approached, our team at Skyeng came up with an idea of a gaming advent calendar. Each day, a new game would be unlocked, and players could earn points by playing them, all leading up to the chance of winning a real-world prize by the year's end.

The timing was tight and a lot of work had to be done swiftly, but we managed to pull it off. The project turned out to be quite successful, attracting a lot of players, boasting high engagement and retention metrics, and, to top it off, making at least one lucky kid a proud owner of a Nintendo Switch.
