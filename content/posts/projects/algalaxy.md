Al Galaxy was designed as a sandbox for kids, offering a playful environment with charming characters while providing educational value. Collaborating closely with children and methodists during the design process, we aimed to seamlessly integrate educational elements into the gameplay, aligning with our primary language learning program.

My role involved creating the initial prototype for the game and subsequently developing the majority of core gameplay features in the resulting product. The most challenging part was setting up characters' rigs and multi-layered animators, supporting different state combinations and utilizing procedural IK animations.

Early results from focus groups and insights gleaned from our research indicated that the game exceled in captivating a child's interest, providing an avenue for parents to interact with their children or even use the product as a rewarding incentive for positive behavior.

The development would continue on, with updates introducing new rooms to explore, mini-games to complete and cartoons to watch.

The game received a wealth of positive feedback from children and their parents, significantly boosting students' engagement metrics.
