 ...The theme of my first ever Game Jam was "Heaven" and somehow this is what we came up with. Despite a slow start in the first 24 hours grappling with ideas, we pulled it off in the next 24. Our trio team consisted of a game designer, an artist, and myself as a developer.

Though a bit stressful, witnessing a compact yet complete game being conceptualized, developed, published, played and reviewed by numerous people in such a brief timeframe was truly rewarding.
