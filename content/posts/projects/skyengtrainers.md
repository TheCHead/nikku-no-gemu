When I initially joined the Skyeng team, our gamedev department was closely tied to the Skysmart Interactive Platform. This platform provided a space for kids to engage with their school curriculum from the comfort of their homes, all within a playful and interactive learning environment.

So, throughout my first year at Skyeng, my focus was primarily on developing mini-games for children as part of their homework. These games, accessible to Skysmart students in WebGL format and being hypercasual, each one emphasizes a singular learning subject.

There were numerous games built for Math and English by our team. Below are examples of what we've been making:

In addition to crafting homework mini-games, we ventured into experimenting with various game formats, to validate or challenge certain hypotheses we had at that time. Here're some of them:
