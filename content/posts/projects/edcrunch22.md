In late 2022, I participated in the EdCrunch conference, Europe's largest conference on innovation in education. My role involved developing a prototype to complement our presentation on integrating games into education and assisting my colleague in delivering it to the audience.

Given our work's focus on children, our discussion revolved around enhancing the educational process to be both engaging and enjoyable without causing harm. 

During the conference, I showcased a live demo I had crafted, transforming a basic test into a playable game in real-time, involving the audience in the conference room. Attendees had the opportunity to vote on various aspects of the potential game, such as selecting a subject (Math or English), choosing a game character and theme, and applying additional visual and audio effects.

Below is a glimpse of how this demo build appeared. I should note that it leans towards intense audio-visual stimulation by the end, and such approach may foster some bad habits in a student. However, it was a deliberate part of the discussion on how to strike a balance and avoid overtuning things.
