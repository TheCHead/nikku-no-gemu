Another project I've built with [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv), but this time of a much larger scope.

This endeavor introduced me to a stack of new Unity and C# techniques, as I've taken on the following topics:
 - melee and range combat
 - pathfinding and patrol paths for enemies
 - player level progression
 - implementing a saving system
 - building detailed levels with terrain and props
 - timelines and cinematics
 - utilizing lighting, particle systems and more

Additionally, it served as an excellent exercise in fine-tuning the balance between player and enemy stats, covering aspects like health, damage, movement, attack speed, experience gained etc.
