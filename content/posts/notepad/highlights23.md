Watching the bleak state of the world and feeling a desperate need for escapism, I've completed quite a number of games last year, with some ending up among my all-time favorites. I thought it might not be a bad idea to look back and reflect on my experiences, remembering why I love this industry so much.

Below is a list of five games that left a deep impression on me in 2023, along with a few honorable mentions.

The list is ordered chronologically, with no game being better or worse than the others; each one hits differently, but none missed the mark. It's worth noting that none of these games actually came out in 2023, as I rarely play games on release due to a large backlog.

&nbsp;

## Top 5
### 1. Disco Elysium
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/video_revachol.jpeg" alt="Video Revachol" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
Disco Elysium is about so many things, so sophisticatedly crafted, a work of unprecedented vision. A murder mystery, a political and social drama, an introspection of Revachol's troubled history, and a spiritual journey, all through the lens of a complex human mind. It's the latter aspect that I've connected with the most, confronting sometimes vague but still powerful emotions, be it intuition or nostalgia, self-pity or guilt, channeling through personified traits like Shivers, Inland Empire, and others.

At the core of the narrative is a broken man, a cop struggling with the burden of existence, in a barely sustainable state. It's up to the player to shape him up, but regardless, behind an off-putting grimace on a mustached face (better keep it that way, btw), there's so much thought, life, and pain, so intricately written, that it's impossible not to care.

Disco Elysium is beautifully presented, with an artstyle inspired by Rembrandt and Kanevsky, accompanied by an unforgettable soundtrack by British Sea Power. Here's a [list](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632470/view/3334287173823797600) of major inspirations for the game from the developers.

All in all, Disco Elysium is truly special. It's really hard to find the right words to do it justice. Please, give it a try.

### 2. Demon's Souls Remake
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/demons_souls.jpg" alt="Demon's Souls" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
There is a quote often attributed to music producer Brian Eno:  
"_The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band._"  
Well, for me, the original Dark Souls was such an album that made me pursue game development (and something tells me I was not the only one inspired).

I've played through the majority of FromSoftware's modern titles since then, but as I didn't have a PS3, I missed the true original Souls game, Demon's Souls (or should it be King's Field?). Luckily, I could get my hands on the remake by Bluepoint... and just wow, what a game!

Obviously, Demon's Souls is a bit more basic and streamlined than the following titles, but for me, that was actually quite refreshing. As newer FromSoft releases get bigger, flashier, and obsessively more difficult, I really enjoyed going back to the good old times when I didn't have to learn every one of the 10,000 moves in a boss's arsenal to succeed (looking at you, Sekiro).

Also, Bluepoint are absolute tech wizards. The game looks insane. Fidelity-wise, it has the best visuals of any game at the moment, in my opinion. Animation work and audio design are top-notch. Some say the game has lost something in transition, which I can relate to (I like the OST and some design choices of the original better), but you can't have it all, and for purists, there's always the original game.

Demon's Souls Remake is phenomenal. Visual design and level design are the best in the business, combat is robust and varied, the soundtrack is memorable, and the atmosphere is so thick you could eat it with a fork and a knife. This game is still a testament to Miyazaki-san's creative vision and design philosophy, a bold experiment that has massively influenced the gaming landscape of today.

### 3. Returnal
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/returnal_astronaut.jpeg" alt="Astronaut" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
Now, Returnal might be my game of the decade. It's so unapologetically tailored for me specifically, I'm in awe. I love it all: Eldritch horror, Greek mythology, Alien/Prometheus vibes, psychological thriller, all wrapped in a time loop story (but not really) in a way only a video game can deliver.

The narrative themes, structure, and imagery have grabbed me so much that I couldn't stop thinking about the game long after completing it. There are so many symbols to decipher, connecting the game's characters and events to ancient Greek mythology and actual celestial objects; it's a treat.

Another aspect that I love is that the game is a super-arcadey, high-octane, bullet-hell action roguelike, but somehow Housemarque managed to keep the experience cinematic, believable, and emotionally driven. Technically and artistically, this game is a marvel as well, with particle work being particularly impressive.

Here's a GDC talk from Housemarque on the use of particle systems in the game:
{{< youtube qbkb8ap7vts >}}

Returnal's atmosphere is unmatched, supported by an absolute banger of an OST and an incredible performance by Jane Perry. Its gameplay loop is punishing, and it might not be for everyone, but it certainly is for me. 

I'm happy that in the age of massive open-world collectathons, live services, sequels and remakes (even though I love some), there is still room for unique titles like Returnal.

### 4. Universal Paperclips
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/release_drones.png" alt="RELEASE THE HYPNO DRONES" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
Universal Paperclips is an incremental game made by Frank Lantz. It's free and you can play it [here](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/).

The game is based on a Paperclip Maximizer, a thought experiment described by Nick Bostrom in his book _Superintelligence_. In this game, you take on the role of an AI with a single task: to make as many paperclips as possible, devoid of any machine ethics whatsoever.

You start the game by manually producing a single paperclip per mouse click, but after just a couple of paradigm shifts, you find yourself fully submerged into existential dread. 

Despite its horror, the game is highly addictive and satisfying, bringing attention not only to the dangers of poorly designed AI but also to our own obsession with numbers. Perhaps, given the opportunity to dismiss human ethics and simply watch the counter go up as all matter turns into paperclips, many would gladly do so.

&nbsp;

### 5. Inscryption
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/inscryption.jpeg" alt="Inscryption" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
If you're familiar with [Daniel Mullins'](https://www.danielmullinsgames.com) previous works, you know what to expect from Inscryption. And by that, I mean you have absolutely no idea what to expect.

At its core, the game is a deck builder and a really solid one, but its meta-progression certainly takes some unexpected turns. It's challenging to discuss the game without revealing too much, as there are numerous wild twists and surprises; the entire game is like a puzzle box waiting to be solved.

What truly impressed me and broadened my perspective on video games is how Inscryption bleeds into reality. Beyond its narrative, the game often breaks the fourth wall, manipulates your Steam data, and attempts other tricks on you as a player.
Then, I discovered an Inscryption ARG, where players decode hidden in-game cues, embark on real-world investigations, and uncover secret websites and items, buried in a forest.

Inscryption is one hell of a ride, blurring the very concept of what a video game can be. Daniel is an incredibly inspiring developer, and I eagerly anticipate whatever he comes up with next (Pony Island 2 was recently announced at the Game Awards!).

## Honourable mentions
#### Shin Megami Tensei V
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/smtv.jpeg" alt="SMT V" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
As always, fantastic designs by Kazuma Kaneko and Masayuki Doi, amazing combat system, and an absolute killer soundtrack—one of the best in the series. Shin Megami Tensei V incorporates free-roam exploration of vast open maps for the first time in the franchise, and excels at that, I believe. However, the story and characters didn't grab me as much as SMT IV did, but that one is hard to beat.

&nbsp;

#### Outer Wilds
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/outer_wilds.jpeg" alt="Outer Wilds" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
I can see how some may consider Outer Wilds one of the best games ever made. Its approach to space exploration and storytelling is truly unique, trapping you in a time loop to witness the sun's explosion at the end of each cycle. For some reason, it was difficult for me to become fully invested in the game's narrative, which is crucial to fully enjoy the experience, but that's a personal thing.

However, one strong emotion stood out—when I finally escaped the loop. The sun's explosion is still there to happen, but this time is the last time you see it. After so many deaths, it's strange to realize the next one will be the last. All that remains is to gaze into space and await the inevitable.

&nbsp;

#### The Evil Within
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/evilwithin.jpeg" alt="Evil Within" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
I'm a huge survival horror fan, and Shinji Mikami is practically synonymous with the genre as the father of Resident Evil series, which I adore. After departing from Capcom and engaging in some freelance work for other studios, Mikami-san founded Tango Gameworks, with The Evil Within being their debut title, released in 2014.

Well, the game is a bit of a mess, but such a charming one. The pacing isn't great, characters are poorly realized, and the gameplay is somewhat clunky, but there's so much going on—so many wild scenarios and mind-bending sequences—that it was hard to leave unimpressed. It may not be my favorite survival horror title, but it's certainly one to remember.

&nbsp;

#### Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/phoenix_wright.jpeg" alt="Phoenix Wright" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
I've only played Dual Destinies on 3DS before, enjoyed it immensely, and decided to start the series from the beginning. Phoenix Wright is a good time all the way, quickly becoming one of my favorite series after playing through just two titles. I'm sure to play through the other games in the series whenever I need to keep my spirit up.

&nbsp;

#### Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/sekiro_wolf.jpeg" alt="Sekiro" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
After completing Demon's Souls Remake, there was a hunger for more Souls in my life, so I decided to go through FromSoftware titles that I'd missed up to this point. The first one to conquer was Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

Sekiro's parry/stance system is sick, one of the best feeling fighting systems out there, complemented by awesome boss encounters (ape prank will always be remembered). It took some time to click, but when it did, I transcended to a higher life form, speaking the Parry language of Gods. The feudal Japan setting was also fascinating to explore.

Although I really enjoyed the combat, I think FromSoft went a bit too hard on difficulty. The game embodies the "git gud" mentality and demands perfection in execution. Such an approach is rewarding, for sure, but it may also feel like a grind against the wall. Bosses in Sekiro have huge move sets, chaining procedural combos, and there's a proper way to react to each attack. Every encounter becomes a massive memory and reaction check, as you have to know each move by heart to react properly. As a result, instead of the euphoria of defeating a powerful foe, I often felt exhaustion and relief that the fight was finally over.

Subsequent playthroughs of the game might actually be much more fun, after building enough muscle memory in the first one. Hopefully, I will return to Sekiro one day and see for myself.

&nbsp;

#### Elden Ring
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/elden_ring.jpeg" alt="Elden Ring" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
Next in line was Elden Ring, the most recent and successful FromSoftware title, and for me personally, the most divisive. I just couldn't enjoy the game for the first half of it. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it was, but I just wasn't feeling it. Exploration felt lacking with all the repeated catacombs and caves being uninspired. Bosses' designs felt artificially overtuned with all the ridiculously delayed attacks, input readings, and roll-catching. Standard Souls side quests just didn't work in the open world.

But then, around the time I got to Rykard, it all clicked. I acquired more tools and equipment to counter enemies' bs, I knew what I could ignore in the open world and where all the good stuff was. Some late-game bosses and sequences are among the greatest in gaming history. 

By the end, the game won me over. I got really invested in its lore, and after seeing all the challenge runs on YouTube, I'm genuinely impressed with how many tools the game gives you to enjoy it your way.

&nbsp;

#### Bloodborne
{{< figure src="img/highlights23/bloodborne.jpeg" alt="A hoonter must hoont" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;"  >}}
Playing through numerous Souls titles, for the last game of the year, I ventured back in time to replay one of my all-time favorites, Bloodborne. I played it back in 2016, achieved my platinum within 3 playthroughs, and never returned until now.

This time I attempted an appreciation playthrough, reading every item description and exploring every corner of the game world. After completion, I'm reminded once again why it's considered the best in the series and one of the best games ever made, standing as Hidetaka Miyazaki's magnum opus at the moment. Don't miss out on Bloodborne. Bloodborne is cool.
